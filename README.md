### 📖 Introduction

Welcome to **ZenFocus**! This is a special project for us because it is our **first-ever Hackathon submission**. 🚀

We built this website to help users maintain productivity while keeping a calm and focused mind. In a world full of distractions, ZenFocus aims to provide a clean, distraction-free environment to manage tasks and stay on track.

**Why we built this:**
* To challenge ourselves in a competitive environment.
* To solve the problem of digital clutter and lack of focus.
* To learn how to ship a project from idea to deployment in a limited time.
